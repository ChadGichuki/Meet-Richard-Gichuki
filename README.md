# Meet-Richard-Gichuki
This is my First Personal Website, built with html, css and Javascript.
I built it as my first project submission for the Fullstack Software Development Program at Moringa School. This notwithstanding, I gave it my best effort and I'm quite proud of it.

## Objective
The purpose of building this website was to test and showcase my growing frontend development skills.

## Overview
The project consists of 5 main pages, with only the first three being active at the moment.
The 3 active pages are:
- Home.html
- Bio.html
- Blog.html

There are two script files adding user interactions with the page:
-script.js (which is linked to home.html)
-script_two.js (which is linked to bio.html)

There is the style.css (probably the longest of all the files) which contains all the styling for the website.

The last file you will encounter is test.jpg which is a photo of myself being used as the background for the home page. Credits to Lexxyphotography for that amazing shot.

## Technologies
No frameworks were used on this project. However, it is worth noting that I used Google fonts to import 4 font styles.

## License
I don't how this works but feel free ti use anything you fin intersting to you.

## How can you contribute
Improving the css properties for display on devices of all screen sizes.
