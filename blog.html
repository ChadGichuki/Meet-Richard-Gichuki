                       <h2>Civil Engineer to Software Developer</h2>
                       <p>
                           Just after I had quit my job, I read a news article about 'The Great Resignation'. 
                           There were so many other people like me out there. People who were tired of their 
                           present dismal working conditions; people who hated how stuck they felt in their 
                           current jobs. People who's ambition allowed them to hope that the bright future 
                           they could see in the horizon was indeed attainable...

                        <p>
                            ... This is a contextualization of CS50's Fiftyville (Problem Set 7) ... <br>
                            It happened on a cold July afternoon, Thursday the 7th to be exact. 
                            Marurui estate was abuzz with activity as usual; sellers were selling, 
                            buyers were buying and idlers were idling. Ghafla bin vuu wezi wenye misuli 
                            tinginya na miraba minne walitokea na kuipora Mpesa shop ya Mama Shiku...

                        <h2>Wet Fry Chicken Algorithm</h2>
                        <p>
                            At the risk of being simplistic let me give my best analogy of what an algorithm is:
                            Mercy's Algorithm:<br>
                            When Mercy prepares Wet Fry Chicken she: Washes the chicken -> boils it in a pot under 
                            medium heat with garlic and ginger -> chops ALL the other ingredients and puts them in 
                            separate bowls -> takes out the chicken once cooked and places it in a separate bowl -> warms 
                            the pan before adding oil...
